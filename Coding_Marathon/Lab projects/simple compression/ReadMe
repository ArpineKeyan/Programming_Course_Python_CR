Trivial Compression (zip)
Write a program that reads the content of the text file, compresses it with an
algorithm (preferable your own) and saves it in a file. The aim is to reduce the size
of the file as much as possible. The algorithm can be of any eciency, for
example, you can replace the string “aaaabbbcc“ with “a4b3cc“, where the number
shows how many times the character is repeated in a word.
The program should also allow to decompress the text that has already been
compressed with your own algorithm. This means that the menu of the program
should allow the user to choose between compression and decompression. Then
the user provides a text file which contains a text that should be compressed or
already compressed text that should be decompressed.
